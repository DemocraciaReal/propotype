Read Democracy prototype I
===========================                                                     

Real democracy in its core meaning is nothing more that this: Each person of a population represents himself and so has the right to vote over all significative decisions in the day to day activity of the government. 

That was an utopia 100 hundred years ago because of practical impediments. It was simply impossible for the entire population of a country – or a significant part of it – to cast a vote many times a week. There was no technology to support that. People would have to travel miles in order to casta  vote and then go back. That would be a nonsense.

But this the XXI century and internet has made possible for people in very distant places to communicate with each other. 

We believe that technology can help to support a real democracy.

This project is a prototype of a software to support  a Real Democracy. The objective of this project is to gain practical knowledge of the problem that we want solve: What features does it need to be implemented in a web software in order to make possible a real democracy – active participation of a large population over the significative decisions that the government makes.
